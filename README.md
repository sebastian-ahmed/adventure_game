# Adventure Game
"Adventure game" is an old-school dungeon-crawler style text-driven game. It was written in the summer of 2020 as a pedagogical exercise to teach my children to code Python. It is designed to teach the basics of Python but also include basic classes. Despite being text-driven, it does render a graphical view of the current room and player inventory and stats using the Turtle module.
